Hi, welcome to my homepage! I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego, advised by [Prof. Prithviraj (Raj) Ammanabrolu](https://prithvirajva.com/) at [Pearls Lab](https://pearls-lab.github.io/)🧋.

My research focuses on **trustworthy AI for language models and agents**, with an emphasis on **[pluralistic alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01167)**, **[reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.152.pdf)**, and **[interpretability](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=FaOeBrlPst)**. I develop methods that help systems <u>infer user intent through interaction</u>, formalize it into clear, scalable evaluation criteria, and use these signals to <u>train and assess</u> agents on complex, long horizon tasks where success is <u>difficult to verify</u>. I also study **reinforcement learning** for adaptive multi-agent systems that support effective human AI collaboration while respecting diverse values and constraints. My long term goal is to build **safe, controllable agentic systems** that reliably accomplish economically valuable work, and to understand their social and ethical implications in real decision-making.

I have previously interned at <img src="{{ '/assets/img/ty_logo.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Tongyi Lab Logo" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: middle; margin: 0 0em;"> Alibaba Tongyi Lab, where I was advised by [Dr. Liuyi Yao](https://osier-yi.github.io/), working on research related to *personalized alignment, role-play agents, and reasoning*. 

Prior to joining UCSD, I completed my Master's in Interdisciplinary Data Science at 💙 Duke University, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Brandon T. Fain](https://sites.duke.edu/btfain/) and [Prof. Bruce W. Rogers](https://surgery.duke.edu/profile/bruce-w-rogers). Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree from the 🇦🇺 University of Melbourne, majoring in Economics and Finance with a minor in Statistics.
