Hi, welcome to my homepage! I'm a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego, advised by [Prof. Prithviraj (Raj) Ammanabrolu](https://prithvirajva.com/) at [Pearls Lab](https://pearls-lab.github.io/).🧋🏖

My research interests lie within the area of trustworthy AI, focusing on [pluralistic alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01167), [reasoning](https://aclanthology.org/2025.emnlp-main.152.pdf), and [interpretability](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=FaOeBrlPst)
of large language models. I’m also passionate about leveraging reinforcement learning to develop advanced multi-agent systems, exploring their synergies to enhance collaborative problem-solving, and investigating their social and ethical implications
in decision-making.

I have previously interned at Alibaba Tongyi Lab, where I was advised by [Dr. Liuyi Yao](https://osier-yi.github.io/), working on research related to personalized alignment, role-play agents, and reasoning. 

Prior to joining UCSD, I completed my Master's in Interdisciplinary Data Science at 😈 Duke University 💙, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Brandon T. Fain](https://sites.duke.edu/btfain/) and [Prof. Bruce W Rogers](https://surgery.duke.edu/profile/bruce-w-rogers). Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree from the 🇦🇺 University of Melbourne 🦘, majoring in Economics and Finance with a minor in Statistics.
