I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego, advised by [Prof. Prithviraj (Raj) Ammanabrolu](https://prithvirajva.com/) at [Pearls Lab](https://pearls-lab.github.io/).🧋🏖

My research interests lie within the area of trustworthy AI, focusing on interpretability, fairness, reasoning, and robustness of ML models. I'm particularly passionate about large language models and developing advanced multi-agent systems, exploring their synergies to enhance collaborative problem-solving, and investigating their social impacts and ethical implications in decision-making.📚 

Prior to joining UCSD, I completed my Master's in Interdisciplinary Data Science at Duke University, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Brandon T. Fain](https://sites.duke.edu/btfain/) and [Prof. Bruce W Rogers](https://surgery.duke.edu/profile/bruce-w-rogers).
